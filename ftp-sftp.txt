SFTP - secure File Transfer Protocol
SSH -Secure Shell protocol


SFTP is packet-based protocol   
----- FTP is text based 

when FTP send a command such as - DELL file.txt
SFTP would send a binary 0xBC and then "file.txt".


SFTP is faster.


FTP uses password authentication created by the user

They are two completely different protocols.

FTPS is FTP with SSL for security. It uses a control channel and opens new connections for the data transfer. As it uses SSL, it requires a certificate.

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol/Secure File Transfer Protocol) was designed as an extension of SSH to provide file transfer capability, so it usually uses only the SSH port for both data and control.

In most SSH server installations you will have SFTP support, but FTPS would need the additional configuration of a supported FTP server.

FTPS (FTP/SSL) is a name used to provide a number of ways that FTP software can perform secure file transfers. 
Each way involves the use of a SSL/TLS layer below the standard FTP protocol to encrypt the control and/or data channels.

Pros:
-----

Widely known and used
The communication can be read and understood by a human
Provides services for server-to-server file transfer
SSL/TLS has good authentication mechanisms (X.509 certificate features)
FTP and SSL/TLS support is built into many internet communications frameworks

Cons:
-----

Does not have a uniform directory listing format
Requires a secondary DATA channel, which makes it hard to use behind firewalls
Does not define a standard for file name character sets (encodings)
Not all FTP servers support SSL/TLS
Does not have a standard way to get and change file or directory attributes
SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol that provides file transfer and manipulation functionality over any reliable data stream. It is typically used with the SSH-2 protocol (TCP port 22) to provide secure file transfer, but is intended to be usable with other protocols as well.

Pros:
-----

Has a good standards background which strictly defines most (if not all) aspects of operations
Has only one connection (no need for a DATA connection)
The connection is always secured
The directory listing is uniform and machine-readable
The protocol includes operations for permission and attribute manipulation, file locking, and more functionality


Cons: 
-----

The communication is binary and can not be logged “as is” for human reading
SSH(Secure Shell) keys are harder to manage and validate
The standards define certain things as optional or recommended, which leads to certain compatibility problems between different software titles from different vendors.
No server-to-server copy and recursive directory removal operations
No built-in SSH/SFTP support in VCL and .NET frameworks
